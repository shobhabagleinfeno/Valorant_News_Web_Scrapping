## Project Structure

Valorant-News-Web-Scraping/
â”œâ”€â”€ valo_news_scraper.py   # Main Python script
â”œâ”€â”€ valo_news.csv          # Output CSV file (after running the script)

3) After execution, the scraped data will be saved in a file named valo_news.csv.

## How It Works
### Web Scraping:
The script sends a request to the target website to fetch its HTML content.
### Data Extraction:
The BeautifulSoup library is used to parse the HTML and extract news-related elements like titles, timestamps, and images.
